# Systems of Linear Equations

## Linear Equations

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
__Definition__
A linear equation with the variables $x_1, ..., x_n$ can be written in the form 
$$
a_1x_1+a2_x2+...+a_nx_n=b
$$
:::

The components of the linear equation is as so:

- Each $x$ is a variable (usually unknown)
- Each $a$ is a weight to each variable (usually known)
- Each $b$ is the product of every $a_ix_i$ (usually known)
- Each component above must be a constant

The following equations __are__ linear:

- $3x_1 + 5x_2 = 16$
- $0_x1 + 3x_1 = 12$
- $2x_1 + \pi x_2 -x_3 = 2\sqrt{6}$

The following equations __are not__ linear:

- $x_1x_2 = 20$
- $2\sqrt{x_1} + x_2 = -6$
- $x_1^3 = 12$

# Solutions to Linear Equations

__Definition__
A solution to a linear equation is a list of numbers $(x_1, x_2,...,x_n)$ that makes a linear equation true.
:::

For the linear equation: $3x_1 + 5x_2 = 16$, the solution is that $x_1$ is 2 and $x_2$ is 2. This, with substitution, would be written as follows: $(3\times 2) + (5\times 2) = 16$
